    "text": "Survey design\nSchelling’s classroom survey asked students questions challenging them to ambiguously “win” a game by coordinating with a stranger. Famously, he asked where and when the participants would meet a stranger in New York City without any prior communication. Additionally, the survey included a series of questions encouraging convergence on a response in more “game-like” circumstances: guessing a number, flipping a coin, etc.\nThis survey is in essence an abbreviated version of Shelling’s. It includes a selection of the “game-like” questions taken directly from Schelling’s survey. Because this survey was conducted at the University of Chicago, the where-and-when question asks about meeting a stranger in Chicago rather than New York City. The survey additionally includs two follow-up questions that were not included in Schelling’s data, changing the interpersonal context between the participant and hypothetical partner."

These primarily consisted of responses in the “meeting a stranger” or “meeting a student” questions. Since these questions specify that the other party is unknown to the respondent, responses should not assume prior familiarity or experience with the other party, for example “their house”, “the last place we last met”, “where we usually see each other”, or “where you expect them to be at a certain time.”\nResponses to the meetup location questions were coded as “Other” if they included multiple locations without rankings (e.g., “pret or hutch”), were overly vague (e.g., “a major center within the city that everyone knows about”), or fanciful/impossible (e.g., “THE MOON!”)."
