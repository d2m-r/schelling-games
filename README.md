# Schelling Games

## Overview

This project imports data from a Google Form where participants play "Schelling games" designed to demonstrate the ability to coordinate in the absence of communication in order to "win" cooperative (vs zero-sum) games.

Importantly, this is by no means intended to present reliable, rigorous data or to make any contribution to any literature whatsoever. Instead, this is intended to be an interactive exercise for two contexts:

1.  Introducing students to concepts around non-verbal communication, cooperative interaction, tacit coordination, etc.
2.  Offering an example repository to students getting started with R, Quarto, and GitHub.

For anyone falling into the second category who is using this repo as a reference, you should note that this repo uses Quarto to create both an APA formatted manuscript (i.e., a Quarto document using the apaquarto extensions) and a Quarto website for displaying survey results.
If you are only interested in one or the other, not all files in the repo (or lines of code in specific project-level files) will be necessary for your purposes.

Finally, because this repo is intended to be a learning tool, the .qmd and .R files contained within include many comments in both the markdown and code. 
Some comments are very over-explain-y. 
Others are questions or challenges to prompt you to think about why some things are the way they are and what better alternatives might be. 
In other words, these scripts are not a good example of how (or how much) to use informative comments effectively in your own work, but they should be helpful in other ways.
