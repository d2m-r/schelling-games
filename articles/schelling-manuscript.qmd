author-note: "This manuscript is for educational purposes only. This document and all other content in the parent repository was created as a demonstration of a \"finished product\" for the class *From Data to Manuscipt in R* at the University of Chicago. The repo is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/nrdowling/schelling-d2m. The survey and responses may also be used to stimulate discussion in lessons about Schelling's focal points and coordination games, with the caution that this should in no way be considered a rigorous empirical study."

abstract: Thomas Schelling introduced the concept of "focal points" in *The Strategy of Conflict* with the intention of expanding the contemporary perspectives of game theory to include cooperative, not just competitive, games in human decision making.
  In this brief report, we consider focal points from a cognitive science perspective. We present data from an informal survey mimicking Schelling's early (and also quite informal) study in *The Strategy of Conflict*. We find similar trends to Schelling's original survey, reinforcing important foundational priniciples about implicit coordination and mutual salience. 
  We discuss our findings as they relate to nonverbal communication and how these concepts may be extended to further our understanding of coordination in everyday conversation.
